## Solution

This was a breather compared to the previous days, especially the previous part 2s. The task is a variation of the rules of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The second part was solvable by adding a while loop and a single additional line to recursively remove all acessible stacks of paper.
